# Be super to each other

We are committed to the open exchange of ideas, freedom of thought and expression, and respectful debate. These require a community and an environment that recognises the inherent worth of every person and group, that fosters inclusion, dignity, understanding, and mutual respect, and embraces diversity.

Complexity . eco is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, ethnicity, political affiliation, nationality, language, or religion – and not limited to these aspects. We aim to foster a collaborative research community dedicated to cooperation, civility, and respect, and do not tolerate harassment in any form.

Exclusive or discriminatory language or imagery, harassment, and hostile behaviour is not welcome. This includes speech or behaviour that intimidates, creates discomfort, or interferes with a person’s participation or opportunity for participation in the satellite. We aim to be an environment where harassment in any form does not take place, including but not limited to harassment based on race, gender, religion, age, colour, national origin, ancestry, disability, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, or gender identity.

Harassment includes but is not limited to: verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination (related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, etc); sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks; inappropriate physical contact; unwelcome sexual attention; and advocating for or encouraging any of the above behaviour.

Participants or members asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

## Implementation

It is the responsibility of the satellite participants as a whole to promote an inclusive and positive environment for our scholarly activities. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed (active bystander principle), or have any other concerns, please contact one of the organisers.

We value your, and everyone’s, participation in our satellite. Your support will help keep our community and our events a safe, welcoming, and friendly space for all fellow participants!

## Protocol for conflict resolution

### Report

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed (active bystander principle), or have any other concerns, please immediately contact a satellite organiser, or a participant you trust.

### Escalate

Find an event organiser. They will assist you. These parties will help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment and will help them to feel safe for the duration of the event.

### Resolve

The organisers will require anyone engaging in harassing behaviour to cease immediately or face expulsion or other sanctions.
Those sanctions can include reporting to the individual’s organisation, and supporting the victim in making informal or formal complaints via that organisation’s processes.
If an incident results in corrective action, then the organisers will support those harmed by the incident, both publicly (where appropriate) and privately.
If any individual encounters problems or issues attempting to help a victim of harassment while following our anti-harassment policy and protocol, they are encouraged to engage with the organisers for clarifications and/or to seek revisions. We are very open to revising any part of our policy or protocol if needed to ensure a safe and welcoming community in which harassment is not tolerated.
